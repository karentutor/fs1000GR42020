                    may hold one pound of uranium and one pound of thorium, for
                    conducting nuclear experiments. But, they will be fined
                    $1,000,000 should there be a nuclear explosion.

                    Fiji is made up of 333 islands, with 223 of them being
                    uninhabited.

                    Strange but true, it is possible to be in two different time
                    zones at the same time when on the island of Taveuni due to
                    the fact that Fiji is spread across the international
                    dateline.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The total area of the islands amounts to 7,095 square miles
                    (18,376 square kilometres).

                    And from this land the agricultural industry produces
                    sugarcane, coconuts, cassava (tapioca), rice and cattle.

                    Samoa (formerly known as Western Samoa) is a country
                    consisting of two main islands and 8 small islets in the
                    South Pacific Ocean.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Obesity is seen as a status symbol in Samoa, where being
                    overweight shows prosperity, wealth and ironically, good
                    health!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Just two of the islands – Savai’i and Upolu – account for
                    more than 99% of the country’s land with around 95% of the
                    population living on the two islands.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    One of Samoa’s most recognisable sites is the To Sua Ocean
                    Trench, a giant 20m-deep sinkhole with an underwater passage
                    linked to the sea.
